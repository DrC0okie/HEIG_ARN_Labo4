## Introduction

In the first part of this practical work, we will use three different ways to classify images of digits from the `MNIST` dataset : MLP, MLP from Histogram Of Gradients (HOG) and convolutional neural network (CNN). 

In a second time, we are going to create another CNN to classify chest x-ray between normal and pneumonia.

This practical work has been made using the Keras framework, a high-level neural networks library, written in Python, capable of running on top of TensorFlow.

## Introductive questions

> Question: *What is the learning algorithm being used to optimize the weights of the neural networks, and what are the parameters (arguments) being used by that algorithm?* 

The algorithm used to optimize the weight is RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation). According to the keras documentation, these are the default parameters used:

```python
tf.keras.optimizers.RMSprop(
    learning_rate=0.001,
    rho=0.9,
    momentum=0.0,
    epsilon=1e-07,
    centered=False,
    weight_decay=None,
    clipnorm=None,
    clipvalue=None,
    global_clipnorm=None,
    use_ema=False,
    ema_momentum=0.99,
    ema_overwrite_frequency=None,
    jit_compile=True,
    name="RMSprop",
    **kwargs
)
```



> Question: *What loss function is being used ? Please, give the equation(s)*

The categorical crossentropy is used. This loss function is used for classification tasks where labels are one-hot encoded. The categorical crossentropy loss, $L$, for a single sample is given by:

\begin{equation}
L = -\sum_{c=1}^C y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$ is the number of classes.
    \item $y_c$ is the true probability of the sample belonging to class $c$, which in the case of one-hot encoding, is 1 for the true class and 0 for all other classes.
    \item $\hat{y}_c$ is the predicted probability of the sample belonging to class $c$, as output by the model.
\end{itemize}



For a dataset with multiple samples, the total categorical crossentropy loss is often computed as the mean of the losses for individual samples:

\begin{equation}
L_{total} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{c=1}^C y_{i,c} \log(\hat{y}_{i,c})
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$ is the number of samples in the dataset.
    \item $y_{i,c}$ and $\hat{y}_{i,c}$ are the true and predicted probabilities for the $i$-th sample and class $c$, respectively.
\end{itemize}

## Experiment 1: Digit recognition from raw data

This experiment aims to develop and evaluate a `shallow neural network model` to classify handwritten digits from the `MNIST` dataset.

### 1. Model tuning

Those parameters have been tuned to enhance the model performance:

- Activation function sigmoid -> ReLu
- Number of epoch 3 -> 20
- Optimizer RMSProp -> Adam

Adding two layers of 6 neurons was a good compromise, as more neurons didn't improve accuracy. We also tried more than 2 layers, but we didn't have better results. We didn't feel the need to use dropout regularization, as the model didn't show any signs of overfitting.

### 2. Model Architecture

- **Input Layer:** Receives flattened 784-dimensional vectors (28x28 pixels per image).
- **First Hidden Layer:** 2 neurons, uses ReLU activation function. This layer is relatively small, testing the capability of minimal neurons to capture essential features.
- **Second and Third Hidden Layers:** Each with 6 neurons and ReLU activation, aimed at gradually processing features extracted by the preceding layer.
- **Output Layer:** 10 neurons (one for each digit) with a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.

The model uses a sequential layout in Keras, facilitating a straightforward stack of layers with direct forward connections.

### 3. Weights

Input : 1570

First layer : 6 * 2 + 6 bias
Second layer : 6 * 6 + 6 bias
Output : 6 * 10 + 10 bias

Total bias : 22 bias

Total number of weights (incl. bias) : 1700 

### 4. Model Summary

| dense_2 (Dense) | (None, 6)    | 42      |
| dense_3 (Dense) | (None, 10)   | 70      |

### 5. Training performance

The shallow neural network was trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 128. The training process shows an initial rapid decrease in loss. The last epochs shows slower improvement, indicating diminishing returns from additional training.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{/home/tim/Documents/HEIG/ARN/labos/HEIG_ARN_Labo4/images/ex_1/training_history.png}
\end{figure}

- **Final Training Loss:** ~ 0.905
- **Final Training Accuracy:** ~ 0.720

These scores suggest that the model struggles to capture the complexity of the data, likely due to the shallow architecture.

The confusion matrix and the mismatch sample give insight about the classification performance:

| Original | -             | RMSProp   | 3        | 4          | 8              | 128        |

#### Architecture

The 2 pix_p_cell model architecture consists of a sequence of densely connected layers :

- **Input Layer:** This layer accepts a flat input with `hog_size` features. Here, `hog_size` is determined by the image size, number of orientations (`n_orientations`), and the number of pixels per cell (`pix_p_cell`). For this experiment, the input layer receives HOG-transformed data rather than raw pixel values, which aims to improve the model ability to recognize patterns related to the shapes and edges of digits.
- **Hidden Layers:**
  - The first dense layer consists of 2 neurons.
  - The second layer has 8 neurons, potentially capturing more complex relationships in the input data after being initially processed by the first layer.
- **Output Layer:** A dense layer with 10 neurons, corresponding to the 10 possible classes (digits 0-9). This layer uses a `softmax` activation function to output a probability distribution over the 10 classes.

#### Weights

To get the number of weight in the first layer, we have to calculate the hog size:
$$
\text{hog\_size} = \left(\frac{\text{height}}{\text{pix\_p\_cell}} \times \frac{\text{width}}{\text{pix\_p\_cell}}\right) \times \text{n\_orientations} = \left(\frac{28}{2} \times \frac{28}{2}\right) \times 8 = 14 \times 14 \times 8 = 1568
$$

$$
\text{input\_layer} = \text{hog\_size} \times \text{neurons} + \text{biases} = 1568 \times 2 + 2 = 3138
$$

The second layer has 8 neurons. Because the previous layer has 2, we have 2 Ã 8 + 8 = 24 weights

The output layer has 10 neurons. Because the previous layer has 8 neurons, we have 8 Ã 10 + 10 = 90 weights

The total number of weights is 3138 + 24 + 90 = 3252.

## Experiment 3: CNN

The goal of this experiment is to train a CNN using the `MNIST` dataset. We are going to try to identify a good neural network configuration that automatically extracts and learns the optimal features necessary for accurate digit recognition. The best performing model will then be analyzed.

### 1. Modifying training duration: increasing epochs

One of the first observations from the given training results is the low number of training epochs. Originally set to 3, this low count result in undertraining. To fix this, we increased the number of epochs to 16. This gives the model more iterations over the training data, giving it a chance to learn and refine its weights and bias.

#### Impact on Performance:

- **Initial Model Accuracy**: 46%
- **Improved Model Accuracy**: 59%

The graph below shows a more stable convergence and a reduction in loss, that indicates an better learning process.

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{/home/tim/Documents/HEIG/ARN/labos/HEIG_ARN_Labo4/images/ex_3/16_epoch.png}
\end{figure}



### 2. Increasing the number of neurons in the fully connected (dense) layer

An good way to increase the model capacity to learn complex patterns is to increase the number of neurons in the fully connected layers. Initially, our model used only 2 neurons in the fully connected layer, which was a limiting factor for the classification.

Changes made to the dense layer of our CNN model:

````python
l0 = Input(shape=(height, width, 1), name='l0')

l1 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l1')(l0)
l1_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l1_mp')(l1)
l2 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l2')(l1_mp)
l2_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l2_mp')(l2)
l3 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l3')(l2_mp)
l3_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l3_mp')(l3)
flat = Flatten(name='flat')(l3_mp)
l4 = Dense(200, activation='relu', name='l4')(flat)
l5 = Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax', name='l5')(l4)

model = Model(inputs=l0, outputs=l5)
model.summary()

### 3. Simplifying the network by removing the third convolutional layer

In our previous model configuration, we observed that the output of the third convolutional layer resulted in a very small dimension (3x3 pixels). This small dimension can restrict the network from learning and keeping hierarchies in the image data, which can lead to problems during classification.

We decided to remove the third convolutional layer, because we though that fewer layers with more significant dimensions could enhance learning and generalization :

````python
l0 = Input(shape=(height, width, 1), name='l0')

l1 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l1')(l0)
l1_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l1_mp')(l1)
l2 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l2')(l1_mp)
l2_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l2_mp')(l2)
flat = Flatten(name='flat')(l2_mp)
l4 = Dense(200, activation='relu', name='l4')(flat)
l5 = Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax', name='l5')(l4)

model = Model(inputs=l0, outputs=l5)
model.summary()
````

Model summary:

| Layer (type)         | Output Shape      | Param # |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| l0 (InputLayer)      | (None, 28, 28, 1) | 0       |
| l1 (Conv2D)          | (None, 28, 28, 2) | 10      |
| l1_mp (MaxPooling2D) | (None, 14, 14, 2) | 0       |
| l2 (Conv2D)          | (None, 14, 14, 2) | 18      |
| l2_mp (MaxPooling2D) | (None, 7, 7, 2)   | 0       |
| flat (Flatten)       | (None, 98)        | 0       |
| l4 (Dense)           | (None, 200)       | 19800   |
| l5 (Dense)           | (None, 10)        | 2010    |

#### Impact on Performance

This change reduced the complexity of the model but also its ability to generalize as showed by the higher test accuracy. However, the training and validation loss curves indicate potential overfitting.  The graph below shows that the validation loss stabilize around 0.1 while the training loss continues to decline. This suggest that its performance on new, unseen data might not improve further without adjustments to prevent overfitting.

###  4. Increasing convolution layers and adjusting kernel size

To enhance our model's capability to capture more features from the `MNIST` dataset, we decided to increase the number of filters in the convolution layers and adjust the kernel size. The first convolution layer's filter count was increased to 8, and the second to 16, both using larger 3x3 kernels instead of the previous 2x2.

````python
l0 = Input(shape=(height, width, 1), name='l0')

l1 = Conv2D(8, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l1')(l0)
l1_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l1_mp')(l1)
l2 = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l2')(l1_mp)
l2_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l2_mp')(l2)
flat = Flatten(name='flat')(l2)
l4 = Dense(200, activation='relu', name='l4')(flat)
l5 = Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax', name='l5')(l4)

model = Model(inputs=l0, outputs=l5)
model.summary()
````

Model summary:

| Layer (type)         | Output Shape       | Param # |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| l0 (InputLayer)      | (None, 28, 28, 1)  | 0       |
| l1 (Conv2D)          | (None, 28, 28, 8)  | 80      |
| l1_mp (MaxPooling2D) | (None, 14, 14, 8)  | 0       |
| l2 (Conv2D)          | (None, 14, 14, 16) | 1168    |
| flat (Flatten)       | (None, 3136)       | 0       |
| l4 (Dense)           | (None, 200)        | 627400  |
| l5 (Dense)           | (None, 10)         | 2010    |

#### Impact on Performance

Moving from a 2x2 to a 3x3 kernel allows the model to get broader feature representations at each layer, improving its capacity to recognize patterns in the image data. On the other hand, by increasing the number of filters, the network can extract a more diverse set of features from the input images, so it can better differentiate the different digits.

#### Observations on Overfitting:

The training loss continues to decrease nearly to zero, while the validation loss shows signs of increase. This suggests that while the model has learned the training data exceptionally well, it may not generalize as effectively on new, unseen data.

### 5. Reducing overfitting with dropout regularization

To mitigate overfitting, we used dropout regularization in our model. This technique is designed to prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping out" a subset of features during the training phase. Drop-out was applied after each convolutional and dense layer before the final classification layer:

```python
l0 = Input(shape=(height, width, 1), name='l0')
l1 = Conv2D(8, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l1')(l0)
l1_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l1_mp')(l1)

#### Impact on Performance

The use of dropout after pooling layers and before the final classification layer makes that the model relies less on any particular set of neurons. By randomly disabling neurons during training, this forces the network to get more robust features. In the following graph, the training curve shows a smooth decline, while the testing curve remains low and stable, converging to the training loss, which signifies an effective learning and generalization across unseen data.

#### Architecture

- **Input Layer : ** l0 receives images of size 28x28 with 1 channel (grayscale images). This is the entry point for data but does not perform any computation.

- **Convolutional Layers : ** l1 applies 8 filters of size 3x3 with the ReLU activation function. The output is 28x28x8 (because `same` padding keeps the output height and width equal to the input).
- l2 applies 16 filters of size 3x3 with the ReLU activation function. This layer's output is 14x14x16, also using `same` padding.

- **Pooling Layers : ** l1_mp and l2_mp perform max pooling with a 2x2 window, reducing the dimensions by half, thus l1_mp results in 14x14x8, and l2_mp results in 7x7x16.
- **Dropout Layers : ** l1_drop**, **l2_drop**, and **l4_drop are used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time. Dropout rates are 0.2 after both pooling layers and 0.5 before the final output layer.

- **Dense Layers : ** l4 is a fully connected layer with 200 neurons and ReLU activation function. l5 is the final output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) using softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

#### Weights

**Convolutional Layer Weights :**

- l1: (3Ã3Ã1)Ã8+8=80(3Ã3Ã1)Ã8+8=**80** parameters
- l2: (3Ã3Ã8)Ã16+16=1168(3Ã3Ã8)Ã16+16=**1168** parameters

**Dense Layer Weights :**

- l4: 784Ã200+200=157000784Ã200+200=**157'000** parameters
- l5: 200Ã10+10=2010200Ã10+10=**2010** parameters

**Total Number of Parameters:**

80 + 1168 + 157000 + 2010 = 160â258



#### Performance discussion

The tuning process showed a good improvement in model accuracy and a decrease in loss, as evidenced by the loss and accuracy curves provided below. The model achieved a final training accuracy of approximately 98.44% and a validation accuracy of 99.10%, proving its effectiveness in recognizing and classifying the digits from the MNIST dataset.

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{/home/tim/Documents/HEIG/ARN/labos/HEIG_ARN_Labo4/images/ex_3/droupout.png}
\end{figure}



The graph shows a convergence where the validation loss decreases, suggesting that the model is not underfitting or overfitting. The training loss continues to decline slightly, indicating that the model could potentially improve with more epoch, however, the test loss seem to stagnate.



\pagebreak



After finishing the training, the model was evaluated on a separate test set:

- **Test Accuracy:** 99.09%
- **Test Loss:** 0.0254

Those numbers show that the model learned the training data effectively and generalized well to new, unseen data. The high test accuracy aligns with the validation accuracy, indicating the good model robustness and capability to perform a reliable classification.

The initial configurations with fewer neurons and layers showed underperformance, likely because the model was less complex and was not able to capture the patterns in the data. The successive tuning, including increasing the number of neurons and introducing dropout layers, helped to achieve better generalization and helped to control overfitting.

The confusion matrix and the mismatch sample give insight about the classification performance:

## Comparison of the experiments and questions

After analyzing those 3 experiments, it is clear that the complexity of the model and the feature representation are important for the classification performance. Shallow networks quickly reach their performance limits, while deeper architectures like CNN show big improvements in accuracy and loss. However, more complex models require more CPU resources (and training time) but they give much better results. The experiment with the CNN showed the power of layer depth, neuron count, and dropout resulting in high accuracy and making it the best performer.

> Question: *The CNNs models are deeper (have more layers), do they have more weights than the shallow ones? explain with one example.*

I our 3 experiments, yes, the shallow models have less weight than the deeper CNN model, however, the relationship between the depth of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the number of weights (parameters) it contains **is not strictly linear**. Deeper networks have generally more layers, which could result in more parameters. However, the size of the layers and the kernel size of the filters also affect the total parameter count.

Furthermore, CNN include layers that do not increase the parameter count (pooling layers and dropout layers). These layers help in reducing the dimensionality of the data passing through the network without adding weights.

Finally, we must take into account the manner how layers are connected. For example, a densely connected layer will have more parameters than a convolutional layer with the same number of output units because each unit in a dense layer connects to all units in the previous layer.

#### Example:

1. **Shallow Neural Network (Model A):**
   - **Input Layer:** Flattened input of 784 (28x28 pixels)
   - **Dense Layer 1:** 128 neurons
   - **Output Layer:** 10 neurons (one for each digit)
   - **Total Parameters:** Parameters in Dense Layer 1 = 784 * 128 + 128 (bias) = 100,480 Parameters in Output Layer = 128 * 10 + 10 (bias) = 1,290 **Total for Model A = 100,480 + 1,290 = 101,770**
2. **Deeper CNN (Model B):**
   - **Input Layer:** 28x28 pixels, no flattening
   - **Conv Layer 1:** 32 filters of size 3x3, stride 1 (padding 'same')
   - **Pooling Layer 1:** 2x2, stride 2
   - **Conv Layer 2:** 64 filters of size 3x3, stride 1 (padding 'same')
   - **Output Layer:** 10 neurons
   - **Total Parameters:** Parameters in Conv Layer 1 = (3 * 3 * 1 * 32) + 32 (bias) = 320 Parameters in Conv Layer 2 = (3 * 3 * 32 * 64) + 64 (bias) = 18,496 Parameters in Output Layer = (Assuming a flattening step produces 64 features): 64 * 10 + 10 (bias) = 650 **Total for Model B = 320 + 18,496 + 650 = 19,466**

In this example, despite having fewer layers, the shallow network (Model A) has more parameters than the deeper CNN (Model B). This difference is explained because the dense layers in the shallow model connect each input to each neuron, resulting in a high number of parameters. In the other hand, the convolutional layers in the deeper CNN model only connect each filter to a local region of the input image, and this reduces the number of parameters despite the increase in depth.

## Experiment 4: Pneumonia Detection Model Performance

The goal of this experiment is to evaluate the performance of a CNN designed to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: normal and pneumonia. The dataset that we used contains 5216 images for training, 16 images for validation and 624 images for testing.

\end{figure}



\pagebreak



### 2. Training Process

The model was trained over 5 epochs with Adam optimizer, Binary Crossentropy loss function and class weight are applied due to imbalance in the dataset, with more weight given to the minority class.



\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{/home/tim/Documents/HEIG/ARN/labos/HEIG_ARN_Labo4/images/ex_4/graph_loss_accuracy.png}
\end{figure}



### 3. Validation Results

- Accuracy: 62.5%
- F1 Score: 66.7%

As we can see in the training output above, the model achieved full accuracy in predicting the validation set in earlier epochs, which dropped in later epochs. This variation might be due to overfitting, given the small size of the validation set.



\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{/home/tim/Documents/HEIG/ARN/labos/HEIG_ARN_Labo4/images/ex_4/validation_matrix.png}
\end{figure}



\pagebreak



### 4. Test Results

- Accuracy: 57.2%
- F1 Score: 70.6%

The accuracy on the test set was lower compared to the validation set, which could indicate that the model ability to generalize needs improvement. The higher F1 score compared to accuracy could indicate that the model is better at managing the balance between precision and recall.

### 6. Discussion

The good performance on the validation set in the first epochs, followed by a perfect score, shows problems in the model ability to generalize, because we don't see the same level of performance on the test set. This difference is probably due to overfitting, caused by the small size of the validation set.

The test results show that while the model has learned to classify, its accuracy is still poor. We could have better results by further tuning the model, specifically with data augmentation to improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

A bigger validation set would provide a more solid basis for tuning and evaluating the model. Implementing more complex augmentation techniques could help the model generalize better from the training data. We could also use dropout regularization to reduce the overfitting. Finally, longer training with early stopping would allow the model to stabilize its performance on the training and validation datasets.
