## Experiment 3: CNN

### Introduction

The goal of this experiment is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. This experiment aims to identify a good neural network configuration that automatically extracts and learns the optimal features necessary for accurate digit recognition. We will modify and evaluate various configurations, comparing their performance to improve upon the initial model provided in the coursework. The best performing model will then be analyzed.

### Modifying training duration: increasing epochs

One of the first observations from the given training results is the low number of training epochs. Originally set to 3, this low count result in undertraining. To fix this, we increased the number of epochs to 16. This gives the model more iterations over the training data, giving it a chance to learn and refine its weights and bias.

#### Impact on Performance:

- **Initial Model Accuracy**: 46%
- **Improved Model Accuracy**: 59%

The graph below shows a more stable convergence and a reduction in loss, that indicates an better learning process.

### Increasing the number of neurons in the dense layer

An good way to increase the model capacity to learn complex patterns is to increase the number of neurons in the dense layers. Initially, our model used only 2 neurons in the dense layer, which was a limiting factor for the classification.

Changes made to the dense layer of our CNN model:

````python
l0 = Input(shape=(height, width, 1), name='l0')

l1 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l1')(l0)
l1_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l1_mp')(l1)

l2 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l2')(l1_mp)
l2_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l2_mp')(l2)

l3 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l3')(l2_mp)
l3_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l3_mp')(l3)

flat = Flatten(name='flat')(l3_mp)

l4 = Dense(200, activation='relu', name='l4')(flat)
l5 = Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax', name='l5')(l4)

model = Model(inputs=l0, outputs=l5)

### Simplifying the network by removing the third convolutional layer

In our previous model configuration, we observed that the output of the third convolutional layer resulted in a very small dimension (3x3 pixels). This small dimension can restrict the network from learning and keeping hierarchies in the image data, which can lead to problems during classification.

We decided to remove the third convolutional layer, because we though that fewer layers with more significant dimensions could enhance learning and generalization :

````python
l0 = Input(shape=(height, width, 1), name='l0')

l1 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l1')(l0)
l1_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l1_mp')(l1)

l2 = Conv2D(2, (2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l2')(l1_mp)
l2_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l2_mp')(l2)

flat = Flatten(name='flat')(l2_mp)

#### Impact on Performance

This change reduced the complexity of the model but also its ability to generalize as showed by the higher test accuracy. However, the training and validation loss curves indicate potential overfitting. 

The graph below shows the training and validation loss over the epochs. The validation loss stabilize around 0.1 while the training loss continues to decline. This suggest that while the model fits the training data, its performance on new, unseen data might not improve further without adjustments to prevent overfitting.

###  Increasing convolution layers and adjusting kernel size

To enhance our model's capability to capture more features from the MNIST dataset, we decided to increase the number of filters in the convolution layers and adjust the kernel size. The first convolution layer's filter count was increased to 8, and the second to 16, both using larger 3x3 kernels instead of the previous 2x2.

````python
l0 = Input(shape=(height, width, 1), name='l0')

l1 = Conv2D(8, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l1')(l0)
l1_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l1_mp')(l1)

l2 = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l2')(l1_mp)
l2_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l2_mp')(l2)

flat = Flatten(name='flat')(l2)

l4 = Dense(200, activation='relu', name='l4')(flat)

#### Explanation for Improvements

Moving from a 2x2 to a 3x3 kernel allows the model to get broader feature representations at each layer, improving its capacity to recognize patterns in the image data. On the other hand, by increasing the number of filters, the network can extract a more diverse set of features from the input images, so it can better differentiate the different digits.

#### Observations on Overfitting:

The training loss continues to decrease nearly to zero, while the validation loss shows signs of increase. This suggests that while the model has learned the training data exceptionally well, it may not generalize as effectively on new, unseen data.

### Reducing overfitting with dropout regularization

To mitigate overfitting, we used dropout regularization in our model. This technique is designed to prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping out" a subset of features during the training phase.

Dropout was applied after each convolutional and dense layer before the final classification layer:

```python
l0 = Input(shape=(height, width, 1), name='l0')

l1 = Conv2D(8, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l1')(l0)
l1_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l1_mp')(l1)
l1_drop = Dropout(0.2, name='l1_drop')(l1_mp)

l2 = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='l2')(l1_drop)
l2_mp = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), name='l2_mp')(l2)
l2_drop = Dropout(0.2, name='l2_drop')(l2_mp)

flat = Flatten(name='flat')(l2_drop)

l4 = Dense(200, activation='relu', name='l4')(flat)
l4_drop = Dropout(0.5, name='l4_drop')(l4)
l5 = Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax', name='l5')(l4_drop)

model = Model(inputs=l0, outputs=l5)
model.summary()
```

#### Explanation for Improvements

The use of dropout after pooling layers and before the final classification layer reduces the model's tendency of relying too much on any particular set of neurons. By randomly disabling neurons during training this forces the network to get more robust features that do not rely on the presence of particular neurons. 

In the following graph, the training curve shows a smooth decline, while the testing curve remains low and stable, converging to the training loss, which signifies an effective learning and generalization across unseen data.

### Final model analysis

Network Topology Description

**Input Layer : ** l0 receives images of size 28x28 with 1 channel (grayscale images). This is the entry point for data but does not perform any computation.

**Convolutional Layers : ** l1 applies 8 filters of size 3x3 with the ReLU activation function. The output is 28x28x8 (because `same` padding keeps the output height and width equal to the input).

l2 applies 16 filters of size 3x3 with the ReLU activation function. This layer's output is 14x14x16, also using `same` padding.

**Pooling Layers : ** l1_mp and l2_mp perform max pooling with a 2x2 window, reducing the dimensions by half, thus l1_mp results in 14x14x8, and l2_mp results in 7x7x16.

**Dropout Layers : ** l1_drop**, **l2_drop**, and **l4_drop are used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time. Dropout rates are 0.2 after both pooling layers and 0.5 before the final output layer.

**Dense Layers : ** l4 is a fully connected layer with 200 neurons and ReLU activation function. l5 is the final output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) using softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

### 2. Model weights

**Dense Layer Weights :**

- l4: 784√ó200+200=157000784√ó200+200=**157'000** parameters
- l5: 200√ó10+10=2010200√ó10+10=**2010** parameters

**Total Number of Parameters:**

## PW4 Questions and conclusion

### Deeper vs. Shallower Models

**Deeper models** (like the current one with multiple convolution and dense layers) generally have more weights due to increased layers and complexity, which allows them to learn more detailed features from the data. However, deeper models also require more computational resources and are more prone to overfitting, which needs strategies like dropout. **Shallower models** might have fewer parameters, making them quicker to train and less prone to overfitting but potentially less capable of learning complex patterns.
